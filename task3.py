"""
Add code for reading back the data from an specific episode and even visualize at random a small subset of the images. 
Create a function for reading the data and another for testing and visualizing the data. 
The test can be just to print on screen data size as you already have for the data storage part but from the loaded data. 
Basically create a function that loads the data into memory and another to visualize specified number of random frames 
and the size of the datasets.
